# Equipment-Replacement-Policy
Abstract

A company needs to decide when to replace its old machines to maximize profits. 
They have data on machine ages, revenues, operating costs, and salvage values. 
Our project is about finding the best time to replace each machine using dynamic programming.
The goal is to make decisions that bring in the most money while keeping costs in check.
We have used python django framework to design our front end.

Mathematical Explanation

The equipment replacement problem addresses the determination of the most economical age for replacing a machine. 
The dynamic programming approach efficiently solves the machine replacement problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and recursively finding the optimal solution at each stage. 

Problem Statement:
Consider a scenario where the machine replacement problem spans n years. At the start of each year, a decision must be made whether to keep the current machine in service for another year or replace it with a new one. The decision is based on factors such as yearly revenue (r(t)), operating cost (c(t)), and salvage value (s(t)) of a machine that ist years old. Additionally, there's a fixed cost (I) associated with acquiring a new machine.

Model Elements:
Stages Representation:
Each year i represents a stage in the problem, ranging from i=1,2,…,n.
Alternatives at Each Stage:
At each stage (year), two alternatives are considered: keeping the machine in service (K) for another year or replacing it with a new one (R).
State Representation:
The state at each stage (yeari) is represented by the age of the machine at the start of that year, denoted as t.
Variable Definitions:
r(t): Yearly revenue generated by a t-year-old machine.
c(t): Yearly operating cost of a t-year-old machine.
s(t): Salvage value obtained by selling a t-year-old machine.
I: Cost of acquiring a new machine in any year.

Objective Function (Recursive Equation):
The objective is to maximize the net income over the remaining years (i+1,i+2,…,n). The recursive equation calculates the maximum net income at each stage based on the decision to keep or replace the machine.
fn−1(t): Represents the maximum net income for the remaining years i,i+1,…,n.
If the machine is kept:
r(t)−c(t)+fi+1(t+1): Revenue generated by the t-year-old machine minus its operating cost, plus the maximum net income for the remaining years with the machine aging by one year.
If the machine is replaced:
r(0)+s(t)−I−c(0) + fi+1(1): Revenue from selling the old machine, salvage values of the machine, minus the cost of acquiring a new machine and its operating cost plus the maximum net income.

Conclusion

The policies obtained represent different sequences of decisions regarding whether to keep or replace the machine at each stage, while still maximizing revenue over the planning horizon.
We provide a interactive interface in our package so that the user can enter the data about his/her machine.  
The optimum decision at each stage that whether we are going to keep or replace a machine is also displayed in the output.
Maximum total cost  user will have  at the end of n years is also calculated and displayed.
